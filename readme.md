First you need to import pandas, streamlit,matplotlib.pyplot
Then you make a title for your project
Then you upload the CSV files
If there isnt any it will say "Waiting to upload..."
But if there is a file uploaded, there will be 5 subheaders and inside the subheaders we will be able to view the data as we want 
We can also generate a chart or plot and see the data graphically 
Voila the code is done
